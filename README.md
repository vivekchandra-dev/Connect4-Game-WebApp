## 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 📦 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`
⚠️ This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!  
It gives you full control over the build tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.  
Use only if you need advanced customizations.
